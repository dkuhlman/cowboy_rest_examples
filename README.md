# cowboy_rest_examples

This repo contains several examples of REST Web applications built
on top of the Erlang Cowboy Web server.

## Contents

1. `cowboy_rest_crud` -- A REST Web app that supports the CRUD
   operations: create, read, update, and delete.

2. `cowboy_rest_otp_process` -- A REST Web app that performs its
   database operations through a supervised OTP process that "owns"
   the DB resource.
